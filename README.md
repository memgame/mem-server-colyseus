[Looking For Collaborator]
-------------------------
Indie Project

Creating a small multiplayer action RPG.

Language: TypeScript, Unity C#

Project Components:
NodeJs Game Launcher with Electron
C# Game Client with Unity
NodeJs Game Server with Colyseus

Specificly looking for someone with experience creating a rpg skill system.
I would like to have an online session where we create together the skill system.
Since the server is writen in TypeScript it would be great if you have experience in TypeScript or JavaScript.
